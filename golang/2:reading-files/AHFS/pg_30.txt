NOTE: The AHFS Classification of Devices (94:00) is derived from the FDA Device Classification Panels. Additional information 
can be found at: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/default.htm
AHFS Classification numbers can be represented in several formats. The format represented here is the same as the one found in 
the printed AHFS Drug Information and demonstrates the four level hierarchy of the system. For example, ceftriaxone is assigned 
to 8:12.06.12. The "8" represents Anti-infective Agents, "8:12" represents Antibacterials, "8:12.06" represents Cephalosporins, 
and finally "8:12.06.12" represents Third Generation Cephalosporins. This allows similar drugs to be grouped and reported on in 
varying levels of specificity. Some drug database vendors only display the numbers, so 8:12.06.12 can also be 08120612.
The number beside each drug in parentheses corresponds to the AHFS internal identifier for that drug's AHFS monograph. If the 
number 0 appears beside a drug, then that drug does not have a corresponding AHFS monograph.
Drug names are bold if they appear under their primary classification (the classification that monograph is printed under in the 
AHFS Drug Information). Drug names are italicized if they appear under a secondary classification. If your system does not allow 
a drug to fall under multiple therapeutic classifications, then pick the primary classification.
